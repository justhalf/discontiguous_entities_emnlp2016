# Description of files

This repository stores the files corresponding to our paper [Learning to Recognize Discontiguous
Entities](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1008/).

`count_graph.py`: Counts the number of (hyper-)paths from the root to the leaves for a sequence of length `n`.

`-k` is the number of components in the discontiguous entity. So "pupils ... dilated" would have k=2

`-n` is the sequence length, which is the number of tokens in the sentence

`-v` is the verbose mode, allows you to see the transition matrix

For example, to produce the transition matrix in the supplementary material, use:

    python count_graph.py -v -k 2 --shared

(This will also print the number of paths on a sequence of length n=4 by default)

Note that the reference to Tang et al. in the ACL Anthology points to an incorrect version. The arXiv version fixes
this mistake.
